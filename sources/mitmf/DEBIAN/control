Description: Framework for Man-In-The-Middle attacks
 The program was created to deal with some of the significant shortcomings
 that Ettercap filters have when modifying HTTP traffic. It tries to provide
 an easily extensible Python interface for on-the-fly manipulation of HTTP
 traffic.
 .
 Currently, it has a number of helpful plugins that allow you to set
 up the MITM attack, inject arbitrary data into a session, launch browser
 attacks from Metasploit, and dynamically replace files with malicious
 versions. Available plugins:

    type
  - AppCachePoison - Perform app cache poison attacks
  - SessionHijacking - Performs session hijacking attacks, and stores cookies
    in a firefox profile
  - BrowserProfiler - Attempts to enumerate all browser plugins of connected
    clients
  - CacheKill - Kills page caching by modifying headers
  - FilePwn - Backdoor executables being sent over http using bdfactory
  - Inject - Inject arbitrary content into HTML content
  - JavaPwn - Performs drive-by attacks on clients with out-of-date java
    browser plugins
  - jskeylogger - Injects a javascript keylogger into clients webpages
  - Replace - Replace arbitrary content in HTML content
